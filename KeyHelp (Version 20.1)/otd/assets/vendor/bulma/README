Version:    0.8.1

Releases:   https://github.com/jgthms/bulma/releases

Homepage:   https://bulma.io/

Notes:      1) Replace the content of /assets/vendor/bulma/scss with the /sass/ directory from the Bulma archive.

            2) Since 0.8.0, the control size increased to 2.5em.
               We do not want this and need to override it in various places to the prior settings
               We can not override it in our main scss files, due the calculated variables rely on a already defined other variable.

               Find the variable values of the following variables and update their value accordingly.
               (These are the values before 0.8.0)

                    $control-height: 2.25em !default
                    $control-padding-vertical: calc(0.375em - #{$control-border-width}) !default;
                    $control-padding-horizontal: calc(0.625em - #{$control-border-width}) !default;
                    $button-padding-vertical: calc(0.375em - #{$button-border-width}) !default;
                    $button-padding-horizontal: 0.75em !default;
